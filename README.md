# generic-devcontainer

My generic .devcontainer & Docker set up for Python development.

## Usage

In the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file, you will need to modify lines 2, 40 & 41
replacing the `<REPO-NAME>` with the name of the repo to use the devconatiner for.
Similarly in the `Dockerfile` you will need to add the `REPONAME` to line 15.
